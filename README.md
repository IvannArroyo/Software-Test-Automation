In order to make my code, program, and software meet its objectives while also being safe, I implement testing strategies such as unit testing, and integration testing. To ensure security, I validate input data and encrypt data using the appropriate algorithms. Understanding user needs involves heavy interactions with the users in the form of interviews, surveys, and prototypes to ensure that the software developed meets the usersâ€™ needs and requirements. As for ensuring the program is both useful and easy to use, I employ the following techniques: user stories, wireframes, and feedback loops. In software development, I employ a systematic approach through the use of Object Oriented Design (OOD), flowcharts, and diagrams to develop flexible and easily maintainable software to enhance the effectiveness of the system.
